# python-api-challenge
  
  In this challenge we were asked to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. The Python code selected 500+ random cities to analyze across the world. 
  After extracting the data from the API we plotted 4 relationships
  1)Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  2)Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  3)Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  4)Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
  
  The relationship between that seems pretty clear is the relationship between temperature and latitide. The closer you are to the equator which in 0 latitude the higher the temperature is. 
 Also noted in the chart is that the southern hemisphere which is the negative latitude is warmer then its northern counterpart. 
 
 Latitude and humiditiy didn't have a clear relationship. It was mostly random if there will be clouds or not. Something to note was that there was less humidity in the -20, 20, and 60 latidude. These are relatively closer to the equator and tropical counties are located here. 
 
 Latitude and Cloudiness didn't have a relationship at all in my opinion. It was cool to see vertical lines on 0 and 100 percent cloudiness. 
 
 Latitude and wind speed wasn't impactful because wind is usually less the 20 mph her on average and thus there were only a handful of cities that were windier then that. It was interesting to see a couple of cities that were at above 30 mph in the -40 latitude range. Would love to explore that data set a bit more.
